# A Custom List Implementation using the Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- [How to TDD a List Implementation in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-test-driven-list)

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through a custom List implementation using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process.
This is not an intro to TDD, so we’re assuming you already have some basic idea of what it means and the sustained interest to get better at it.
Simply put, TDD is a design tool, enabling us to drive our implementation with the help of tests.
A quick disclaimer – we’re not focusing on creating efficient implementation here – just using it as an excuse to display TDD practices.
